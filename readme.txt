== Description ==

Fictive is all about you -- your style, your look, your story. Make it personal with a custom header image, a Gravatar, and links to your favorite social networks. Use Post Formats to dress up your content, add a custom menu and widgets, or keep it simple with a fixed-position header.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Theme Options =

# Gravatar Email #

By default, Fictive uses the email address found under Users -> Personal Settings to generate the Gravatar seen in the header.

If you want to use a different Gravatar account, you can put in an email address in the Gravatar Email field, or leave it blank to remove the Gravatar entirely.

# Sidebar Position #

If you have a small custom menu or few widgets in the sidebar area, selecting Fixed will pin the header on the page, allowing your content to scroll past (see an example of this behavior on the demo site at http://fictivedemo.wordpress.com).

If you have lots of widgets or the screen is small, the sidebar will automatically allow your readers to scroll to see all of the content. By default, the theme is set to Scroll.

= Where is my custom menu? =

You can activate an optional custom menu under Appearance -> Menus, which will be displayed beneath the header area.

= Does Fictive support widgets? =

Yes! You can add widgets under Appearance -> Widgets, and they will appear in the sidebar, beneath the header area.

= Does Fictive support Post Formats? =

Fictive supports Aside, Image, Video, Quote, Link, Gallery, Audio, and Status post formats. Each is denoted with a unique color and symbol.

Image formatted posts will display the Featured Image on single post view as well as the blog index and archives.

Link formatted post titles will link directly to the first link found in the post content.

= How do I add links to my favorite social networks? =

You can add links to a multitude of social services underneath your site title following these steps:

* Create a new Custom Menu, and assign it to the Social Links Menu location.
* Add links to each of your social services using the Links panel.
* Icons for your social links will automatically appear in the header.

Featured Images look best at 634 pixels wide or larger, and are displayed above the post.
